First Task
===========

The solution to first task is provided by **init_script**. This script produces the *plot.png* through the
*plot.py* python script. The program *stream* performs a very large amount of simples operations in order to
check the maximum bandwidth of the system. The program contains several OpenMP directives, thus has been
running with a variable number of threads in a fixed node of ulysess cluster. Roughly, we expect an increasing
bandwidth as long as the number of threads increases too.
